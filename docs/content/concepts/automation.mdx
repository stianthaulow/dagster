# Automation

Dagster offers several ways to run data pipelines without manual intervation, including traditional scheduling and event-based triggers. Automating your Dagster pipelines can boost efficiency and ensure that data is produced consistently and reliably.

When one of Dagster's automation methods is triggered, a **tick** is created, which indicates that a **run** should occur. The tick will kick off a run, which is a single instance of a pipeline being executed.

In this guide, we'll cover the available automation methods Dagser provides and when to use each one.

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, you should be familiar with:

- [Asset definitions][assets]
- [Jobs][jobs] (_optional_)
- [Ops][ops] (_optional; advanced_)

---

## Available methods

In this section, we'll touch on each of the automation methods currently supported by Dagster. After that we'll discuss what to think about when [selecting a method](#selecting-a-method).

### Schedules

Schedules are Dagster's imperative approach, which allow you to specify when a job should run, such as Mondays at 9:00 AM. Jobs triggered by schedules can contain a subset of [assets][assets] or [ops][ops]. Refer to the [Schedules documentation][schedules] to learn more.

### Sensors

You can use sensors to run a job or materialize an asset in response to specific events. Sensors periodically check and execute logic to know whether to kick off a run. They are commonly used for situations where you want to materialize an asset after some externally observable event happens, such as:

- A new file arrives in a specific location, such as Amazon S3
- A webhook notification is received
- An external system frees up a worker slot

You can also use sensors to act on the status of a job run. Refer to the [Sensors documentation][sensors] to learn more.

### Auto-materialize policies <Experimental />

If you want a declarative approach to automating your pipelines, Auto-materialize policies (AMP) may be a good fit. AMPs allow you to assign policies to assets and let Dagster determine the best approach to keeping assets up-to-date while adhering to those policies.

For example, with AMPs, you can update assets based on:

- Whether an upstream dependency has been updated
- Whether an upstream dependency has the latest data from its dependencies
- Whether a materialization has occured since the last tick of a cron schedule
- ... and more

AMPs are declared on an asset-by-asset basis, but can be applied to multiple assets at once. Refer to the [Auto-materializing Assets documentation][auto-materialize-policies] to learn more.

### Asset Sensors <Experimental />

Asset sensors trigger jobs when a specified asset is materialized. Using asset sensors, you can instigate runs across jobs and code locations and keep downstream assets up-to-date with ease.

Refer to the [Asset Sensor documentation][asset-sensors] to learn more.

## Selecting a method

Before you dive into automating your pipelines, you should think about:

- Is my pipeline made up of assets, ops, graphs, or some of everything?
- How often does the data need to be refreshed?
- Is the data partitioned, and do old records require updates?
- Should updates occur in batches? Or should updates start when specific events occur?

The following cheatsheet contains high-level details about each of the automation methods we covered, along with when to use each one.
